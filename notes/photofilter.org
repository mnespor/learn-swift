* Building a photo filter

* I needed to scratch my own itch
** Goals
*** Make it as easy as possible to apply my usual black and white portrait workflow
*** Create a photo editing extension

* Research

* Prototype

* Rebuilding + UI

* Building out the photo editing extension

* Struggles
** The highlights blew out when I selected anything but pure red, green, or blue
** Photos not oriented "up" randomly failed to save with an unhelpful error message
